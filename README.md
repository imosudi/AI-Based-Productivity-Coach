## Directory and File Descriptions

### Root Directory

- **main.py**: Application entry point. Initializes and runs the Flask application.
- **config.py**: Configuration file containing settings like host, port, and debug mode.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies required by the application.
- **README.md**: Documentation on how to install and use the application.

### `app` Directory

The main application package containing all application code.

- **__init__.py**: Initializes the Flask application and brings together all components.
- **logic.py**: Contains the core business logic of the productivity coach.
- **routes.py**: Defines all application routes and view functions.
- **static**: Directory for static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images).
- **templates**: Directory for HTML templates used in the application.


## Application Flow

1. The application starts from `main.py`, which imports and runs the Flask application.
2. The Flask application is defined and configured in `app/__init__.py`.
3. Routes in `routes.py` handle HTTP requests and interact with the logic layer.
4. Core functionality is implemented in `logic.py`.
5. Views are rendered using templates from the `templates` directory.
6. Static assets are served from the `static` directory.

## Development Guidelines

- New routes should be added to `routes.py`
- Business logic should be implemented in `logic.py` or in new modules within the `app` package
- Frontend assets should be placed in appropriate directories under `static`
- HTML templates should be placed in the `templates` directory



## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing the AI-Based Productivity Coach, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Git
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the repository**:
   - Visit https://github.com/imosudi/AI-Based-Productivity-Coach
   - Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
   - This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

2. **Clone your forked repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Based-Productivity-Coach.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Based-Productivity-Coach
   ```

### Setting up a Python Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment keeps the application's dependencies isolated from other Python projects on your system.

#### For Windows:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### For macOS and Linux:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

You'll know the virtual environment is active when your terminal prompt is prefixed with `(venv)`.

### Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command installs all the necessary dependencies defined in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running the Application

No additional configuration is needed as the application uses the existing config.py file with the following default settings:

```python
HOST="0.0.0.0"
PORT=9921
DEBUG=True
```

After installation, you can start the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will be running on http://0.0.0.0:9921 (You can access it via http://localhost:9921 in your browser).

## Usage Guide

Once the application is running, you can:

1. **Create an account or log in** if authentication is required -TODO
2. **Set up your productivity profile** by answering questions about your work habits -TODO
3. **Add tasks and projects** you want to track
4. **Set up habits** you want to develop - TODO 
5. **Start focus sessions** when you're ready to work
6. **Review insights** from the AI coach to improve your productivity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Installation errors**:
   - Ensure you have the correct Python version
   - Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
   - Check for system-specific dependencies mentioned in the error messages

2. **Application won't start**:
   - Ensure port 9921 is not in use by another application
   - Check terminal output for error messages
   - Verify that all dependencies were installed correctly

3. **Dependency conflicts**:
   - Make sure you're using a clean virtual environment
   - Check for specific version requirements in the error messages

## About Pomodoro Technique
<div align="justify">
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks of around 5 minutes. After completing four such intervals (called "Pomodoros"), a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes is taken. This technique aims to improve focus, minimise mental fatigue, and increase sustained productivity. By working with the natural rhythm of concentration and rest, the Pomodoro Technique helps individuals maintain consistent energy levels and reduce procrastination. The technique is especially effective in environments with high cognitive load, where maintaining attention and discipline is key. It encourages goal setting, frequent review, and the ability to estimate effort more accurately over time, contributing to both short-term task completion and long-term productivity habits.
